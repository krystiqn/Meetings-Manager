The application facilitates the management of meetings with friends. MeetingsManager will help you manage your meetings efficiently, you can easily create a meeting for which other users can sign up, you can edit almost all elements of the meeting and add a catchy and encouraging picture as a logo. In addition, you will receive notifications about your meetings every time you log in to the application again.
